                        Xplora is an app that was created with the intention of
                        showcasing the valuable data that NASA has to offer.

                    <p>
                        With the use of the NASA API's, we can take a look at
                        the weather on Mars and a trove of pictures that were
                        taken by the Mars Rovers and satellites.

                    <p>
                        This is a small showcasing of the data that NASA has
                        made freely available to the public. The API's are
                        available on their website and you can take a look and
                        maybe find something I didn't ;).
